Please see the Android and Windows builds for the Lander Demo in this folder.

In order to run the Windows executable, make sure it is located in the same folder as the Lander Windows Demo_Data folder. Also note that within the Windows build, only GUI controls work (Analog stick/slider, buttons, slider).
